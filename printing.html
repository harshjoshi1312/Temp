        <h1>What is 3D Printing?</h1>
        <br>
        <h2 class="heading"><span>Bring your Idea to life with 3D Printing Technology</span></h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          In the 20th century, no other invention affected the mankind more than
          technology did. With the advent of computers in 1950s and internet in
          1990s, the fundamental way of doing things has through massive
          changes. These technologies made our lives better, opened up new
          avenues and possibilities and gave us a hope for the future. It is
          believed that 3D Printing Technology or Additive Manufacturing (AM)
          has the vast potential to become one of these technologies. There is a
          lot of coverage on 3D Printing Technology across many television
          channels, newspapers and online resources. What really is this 3D
          printing that some have claimed will put an end to traditional
          manufacturing as we know it, revolutionize design and impose
          geopolitical, economic, social, demographic and environmental and
          security implications to our everyday lives? The most basic,
          differentiating principle behind 3D Printing Technology is that it is
          an Additive Manufacturing process. And this is indeed the key because
          3D Printing Technology is a radically different manufacturing method
          based on advanced technology that builds up parts, additively, in
          layers at the sub mm scale. This is fundamentally different from any
          existing traditional manufacturing techniques. Traditional
          manufacturing process has evolved a lot over time from hand based
          manufacturing to the automated processes such as Machining, Casting,
          Forming, Drilling, and Molding. Yet these technologies all demand
          subtracting material from a larger block – whether to achieve the end
          product itself or to produce a tool for casting or molding processes —
          and this is a serious limitation within the overall manufacturing
          process. For many applications traditional design and production
          processes impose a number of unacceptable constraints, including the
          expensive tooling, fixtures and the need for assembly for complex
          parts. In addition, the subtractive manufacturing processes, such as
          machining can result in up to 90% of the original block of material
          being wasted. In contrast, 3D Printing process can create objects
          directly by adding material layer by layer in a variety of ways,
          depending on the technology used. Simplifying the ideology behind 3D
          Printing, for anyone that is still trying to understand the concept,
          it could be likened to the process of building something with Lego
          blocks automatically.

          <p>
            In recent years, the use of 3D Printing Technology in the fashion
            industry has increased during the creative process. Additive
            Manufacturing gives fashion a wide range of possibilities for
            prototyping or production and fascinates some designers. Additive
            Manufacturing is now easily applied to rigid creations and geometric
            shapes rather than flexible garments. 3D Printing can significantly
            expand creative possibilities for fashion design. Indeed, it makes
            it possible to create shapes without molds and thus produce elements
            of an extreme intricacy that one could not reach otherwise. NASA is
            also working on printing a 3D mesh coat for cosmonauts.
